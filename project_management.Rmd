This is the second of a six part series summarsing the core concepts of Hadley Wickham's R for Data Science: <http://r4ds.had.co.nz/>. In the previous post, I've written about the R4DS chapters covering data visualization using ggplot2, you can find that post [here](site.baseurl/).

Today I'll summarize importing and exporting data with the readr library as covered in R4DS. I'll also add my own two cents on how to keep an R project tidy and easily replicable. While these topics may sound trivial, they can become a huge headache later on if you don't tend to them. An unorganized project can causing important scripts to go missing, original data to be overwritten, and reproducability to be thrown out the window.

## Organizing a Project in R

Properly organizing a project can be really simple, but it's something that a lot of people don't bother to talk about. Whenever I'm starting a new project, I create a new folder in my documents, giving the project an obvious title, such as turtle_analysis. I always use [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) while working with projects in R. Once I've created te project folder I'll change my working directory to the project folder and then initiate a git repository. 

Creating git repositories and effectively using Github is an entire series of blog posts by itself. For the purposes of this post I'll just point you to Data Camp's [Introduction to Git for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-git-for-data-science). It's a free and high quality four hour course that teaches you everything you need to know about git technology. While you're there, check out [Introduction to Shell for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-shell-for-data-science) as well. 

Once you've followed intiated a git repository inside your project folder you're ready to structure the folder. My project folders always end up looking something like this:

#### turtle_analysis/
|- input/ <br  />
|\-\-\- about_turtles.txt <br  />
|\-\-\- ocean_temp.csv <br  />
|\-\-\- turtle_sizes.csv <br  />
| <br  />
|- scripts/ <br  />
|\-\-\- turtle_eda.R <br  />
|\-\-\- turtle_height_plot.R <br  />
|\-\-\- turtle_width_plot.R <br  />
| <br  />
|- output/ <br  />
|\-\-\- turtle_height.png <br  />
|\-\-\- turtle_width.png <br  />
| <br  />
|- final_analysis.Rmd <br  />
|- final_analysis.html <br  />
|- README.md <br  /> 

I always keep these three main folders within a project folder: input, scripts, and output. the input folder is where I store all of the project's data sources, usually .csv, .txt, and .xlsx files. The scripts folder is where the .R scripts go, and the output folder is where I save the products of those .R scripts.

Your output should always be easily traced back to an input dataset. Each output should have it's own R script in the script folder, the script should have analogous name to the output. Each individual script should explicitily load the dataset and libraries that it requires. Always keeping the link between these three elements of analysis is the key to easy reproducability. 

Summarizing files such as final_analysis.Rmd / .html and README.md (for github) are placed in the project folder directly. Sometimes I make .txt to-do lists and keep them in the project folder as I'm working on the project as well. Summary compile the inputs, scripts, and outputs into one coherent analysis. Not all of the files you generate have to be included in the final analysis, just the ones that you think are important. 

keep commiting to github often, I refer to previous commits in every project ive done. 

i do exploratory data analysis in .Rmd, find something useful create a script for that specifically 

read about how to use rmd in hadley wickhams book, super useful.
