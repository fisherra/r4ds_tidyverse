### r4ds\_tidyverse repository explained

I've completely worked through the online book, [*R 4 Data
Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), by Hadley Whickham. This repository
contains the chapter in R Markdown format for each content-heavy chapter
of the book in *chapter\_notes/*.

The folder *project\_management/* contains a R Markdown and Markdown
file on managing data science projects to keep them clean and
replicable. This folder draws some information from R4DS, and some
information I gathered on my own while creating blog posts.

The folder *tidyverse\_packages/* contains eight blog posts that cover
the eight core tidyverse packages. These packages are thoroughly
explored in the book R4DS, and are thus included in this repository. The
eight core packages are ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, purrr, forecats, stringr,
readr, and tibble.

To access the finished versions of these tidyverse package blog posts,
visit my blog, [fisherankney.com](fisherankney.com).

I highly recommend the book R 4 Data Science, it is approximately 500
pages long and packed full of information. While I was semi-experienced
with R when I began reading the book, my confidence and capabilities
with the language more than doubled in the two months it took me to
fully work through it.
