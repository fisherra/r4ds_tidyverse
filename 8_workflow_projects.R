# Working through Hadley Wickham's R for Data Science 
# Section 1, Chapter 8

# 1. What about your analysis is “real”, i.e. what will 
#    you save as your lasting record of what happened?
# 2. Where does your analysis “live”?

# There is a great pair of keyboard shortcuts that will work together to
# make sure you’ve captured the important parts of your code in the editor:
  
#  Press Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + F10 to restart RStudio.
#  Press Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + S to rerun the current script.

## ALWAYS SAVE FIGURES TO FILES WITH R CODE ##

# In summary, RStudio projects give you a solid workflow that will serve you well in the future:
  
# 1. Create an RStudio project for each data analysis project.
# 2. Keep data files there; we’ll talk about loading them into R in data import.
# 3. Keep scripts there; edit them, run them in bits or as a whole.
# 4. Save your outputs (plots and cleaned data) there.
# 5. Only ever use relative paths, not absolute paths.

# Everything you need is in one place, and cleanly separated from all
# the other projects that you are working on.
